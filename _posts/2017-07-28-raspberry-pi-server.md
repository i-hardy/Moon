With very minimal prior experience with Linux distributions, and none at all with server management, I decided that it would be an interesting first Raspberry Pi project to set up a web server, to host this website and potentially some simple applications.

Through a lot of research and only a minor amount of hair-pulling, over the course of two evenings I set up an Apache server on my brand new Pi, and established a git repo which would automatically build this Jekyll site following a push, minimising the amount of work necessary to keep the site up to date.

This project gave me a taste of basic server management including the use of SSH, a crash-course reintroduction to working with Linux systems, and a much more thorough look under the 'bonnet' of a git repo than had been afforded to me so far in working purely with Github.
