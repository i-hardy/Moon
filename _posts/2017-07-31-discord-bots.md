After a request from a friend who runs a Discord server that I had recently joined, I began to experiment with creating simple bots, as small projects that nevertheless have clear and immediate front-end uses.

My first bot was [Makkachin](https://github.com/i-hardy/makkachin-bot), a bot whose primary function is to create a 'sprint timer' for creative writing challenges- a timer can be set for a custom length of time, and users can opt in to be @-notified of its start and end. The bot also uses regex matching to fetch gifs via the Giphy API.
