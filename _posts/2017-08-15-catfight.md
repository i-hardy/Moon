Intrigued by the possibilities of single-page JavaScript applications, and wanting to get some experience using a popular framework in a familiar context, I used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) as the basis for building [Catfight](https://i-hardy.github.io/catfight/), a Pokemon-style, turn-based fighting game.

Using ES6 for the first time I first built the basic back-end logic based on the prior Sinatra project, [Battle](https://github.com/i-hardy/battle), and then began to implement additional features. Currently I'm working on the back-end logic for a computer player as part of a single-player playmode.
